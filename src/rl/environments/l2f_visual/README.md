### Assets (conta)

Scenes referenced as `conta:<sha1>` are resolved through the conta client (`include/conta/conta.h`):
- By default missing blobs are downloaded from `https://huggingface.co/datasets/rl-tools/conta/resolve/main/data/<sha1>` into `${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/rl_tools/conta` (shared with the render server's Node cache).
- `CONTA_ROOT` (optional): path to a read-only, pre-populated store (e.g. a checkout of the `rl-tools/conta` dataset, or `/data/conta` on infra). Blobs are expected at `$CONTA_ROOT/data/<sha1>`; downloading is disabled and a missing blob is a hard error.
- `CONTA_CACHE` (optional): relocate the writable download cache.
- `CONTA_URL` (optional): alternative download base URL (mirror, `file://` store).

The `conta` CLI target (`src/conta/cli.cpp`) prefetches blobs: `conta <sha1> [more ...]` prints one local path per line.

### Imitation on hyperdrone (`imitation_hyperdrone.cpp`)

`rl_environments_l2f_visual_imitation_hyperdrone` is the port of `imitation_cuda.cu` onto `hyperdrone::tasks::target_frame::World` (frame stack, cached target frame, channel padding, camera/brightness randomization and free-space placement all come from the World; the driver keeps the teacher, student, training loop, logging and artifacts of the original). One device-generic source builds against every raytracing backend:

| Build | Compute | Type policy |
|---|---|---|
| OptiX backend + CUDA toolchain | CUDA (env verbs, teacher, student, training on the GPU) | bf16 parameters/activations/gradients, fp32 master (as `imitation_cuda.cu`) |
| Metal, Vulkan, WebGPU, generic | host CPU (the renderer stays on the backend device) | fp32 |
| `..._hyperdrone_cpu` (CUDA machines only) | host CPU against the OptiX backend, for A/B against the CUDA-compute build | fp32 |

Targets: `rl_environments_l2f_visual_imitation_hyperdrone`, `rl_environments_l2f_visual_imitation_state_estimation_hyperdrone` (`RL_TOOLS_L2F_VISUAL_IMITATION_STATE_ESTIMATION`, teacher drives, 15-dim body-frame label), `rl_environments_l2f_visual_imitation_hyperdrone_small` (`RL_TOOLS_L2F_VISUAL_IMITATION_HYPERDRONE_SMALL`: 2 scenes, 16 instances per scene, 100 steps, one training pass, 64 checkpoint examples — the functional smoke profile for CPU-compute builds; the full profile needs 20 GB of device memory in bf16 or 41 GB of host memory in fp32 for the epoch dataset). Same CLI as the original:

```
rl_environments_l2f_visual_imitation_hyperdrone <scene_directory | scene.glb> [seed]
```

Deliberate differences from `imitation_cuda.cu`: the two active scenes per epoch rotate round-robin over each World's contiguous partition of the 25-scene corpus instead of being drawn at random; the random draw order differs, so runs are compared statistically; CPU-compute builds use fp32 instead of bf16; the target frame is rendered once per episode (identical output, since its pose and brightness are fixed per episode); the timing breakdown is collection/training wall-clock instead of per-kernel CUDA events. Everything else (dynamics, camera geometry and FOV randomization, shading/AA, brightness, target roll/pitch and mismatch, frame-stack layout, teacher, student, optimizer, batch scheme, loss, action-selection rule, checkpoint/video/trajectory artifacts) matches.

Both targets log the same per-epoch metrics to metra under `l2f_visual_imitation/{mse_loss, episode_length, episodes, terminated_share, complete_episode_length, complete_terminated_share, fps, epoch_time_s}` (plus `state_estimation/*` for the SE variants) and tag each run with `l2f_visual_imitation/{target, compute_device, n_environments, steps_per_env, seed}`, so learning curves overlay directly when `METRA_URL` is set. Equivalence check: run `rl_environments_l2f_visual_imitation_cuda` and `rl_environments_l2f_visual_imitation_hyperdrone` on the same corpus for a few seeds each and compare the `mse_loss`, `episode_length` and `terminated_share` curves; the port should lie within the seed-to-seed band of the original.
